# Session State

## Actual status
- Initial monorepo scaffolding completed with Bun workspaces.
- Base directories created: `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared-types`.
- Root workspace configured with `workspaces: ["apps/*", "packages/*"]`.
- Infra files created from PRD: `docker-compose.yml` and `livekit.yaml`.
- Shared TypeScript base created via `tsconfig.base.json`; workspace tsconfigs now extend it.
- Plan 002 completed in `packages/shared-types` with Zod contracts for `POST /auth/token`.
- Shared package now builds to `dist` and exports runtime/types for workspace consumers.
- Unit tests for Zod schemas are implemented and passing (`7` tests).
- Plan 000 gate executed: `bun install`, shared-types build, API typecheck with workspace import, Web typecheck, and runtime import smoke-check.
- Plan 003 completed with NestJS API modules (`Auth`, `LiveKit`, `Session`, `Database`) and `POST /auth/token` implemented.
- Session log persistence implemented via TypeORM entity/table mapping for `session_logs` (PostgreSQL).
- Mandatory API E2E tests for `POST /auth/token` implemented and passing (`3` tests).
- README raiz reescrito em pt-BR com status atual da POC, instrucoes de setup, execucao, testes e endpoint disponivel.
- Backend containerization baseline completed: `apps/api/Dockerfile` created with multi-stage Bun build/runtime flow, aligned with `docker-compose.yml` (`api` service, port `3000`).
- Root `.env.example` added for backend runtime variables: `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`, `LIVEKIT_URL`.
- `apps/web` re-initialized using React + Vite (TypeScript template).
- Frontend mandatory dependencies installed for Plan 004 bootstrap: `@livekit/components-react`, `livekit-client`, `tailwindcss`, `lucide-react`, `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `axios`, plus workspace link `@livemeet/shared-types`.
- `apps/web/package.json` renamed to `@livemeet/web` to keep root workspace scripts (`bun run --filter @livemeet/web ...`) functional.
- `apps/web/vite.config.ts` updated with local dev proxy for `/auth` to avoid CORS (`VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET`, default `http://localhost:3000`).
- Validation executed: `bun run --filter @livemeet/web build`, `bun run --filter @livemeet/api build`, and `docker compose build api` all passing.
- Plan 004 final implementation completed in `apps/web/src` with Lobby -> Token -> Room flow.
- Lobby form implemented with `react-hook-form` + `zodResolver` using `TokenRequestSchema` from `@livemeet/shared-types`, then calls `POST /auth/token` via Axios.
- Axios request/response now strictly typed with shared interfaces and runtime-validated with shared Zod schemas.
- Room view implemented with `LiveKitRoom` + `VideoConference`, connection toast/badge, and media-device error feedback.
- LiveKit base styles imported via `@livekit/components-styles`; Tailwind integrated through PostCSS (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) for minimalist UI styling with `lucide-react` icons.
- Per testing policy, no React UI unit/component tests were added.
- Validation executed for this step: `bun run --filter @livemeet/web build`, `bun run --filter @livemeet/web lint`, and `bun run --filter @livemeet/api build` all passing.
- Plan 005 infrastructure preparation completed.
- `apps/web/Dockerfile` added with multi-stage build (Bun builder) and static runtime via `nginx:alpine`.
- `apps/web/nginx.conf` added for SPA serving on port `5173` with fallback to `index.html`.
- `docker-compose.yml` reviewed and updated so LiveKit RTC UDP mapping is explicit on `7882:7882/udp`; UDP range `50000-50050/udp` already aligned.
- `docker-compose.yml` services, env vars, and network remain aligned with PRD Section 11.1 (`livekit`, `redis`, `postgres`, `api`, `web` on `livemeet-net`).
- `livekit.yaml` reviewed and aligned with PRD Section 11.2 (`port 7880`, `udp_port 7882`, `tcp_port 7881`, `50000-50050`, `devkey/secret`).
- Manual validation checklist created at `.context/manual_test_checklist.md` with TP01-TP10 checkboxes from PRD Section 15.5.
- Validation executed for this step: `bun run --filter @livemeet/web build`, `docker compose config`, and `docker compose build web` all passing.
- Frontend infrastructure blocker resolved: `POST /auth/token` returned `405 Not Allowed` from `nginx` in containerized web flow.
- `apps/web/nginx.conf` now proxies `/auth` requests to `http://api:3000`, restoring login/token flow in Docker Compose.
- API container dependency blocker resolved: startup failed with `Cannot find package 'reflect-metadata'` from `apps/api/dist/main.js`.
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` runtime stage now copies workspace runtime dependencies from `apps/api/node_modules` (and `packages/shared-types/node_modules`) in addition to root `node_modules`.
- Validation for API image fix: `docker compose build api` passed, and container entrypoint starts NestJS successfully until expected env validation (`DATABASE_URL`) when run without Compose envs.
- Root `README.md` was rewritten in English and aligned with current implementation status (Plans 000-005 done), Dockerized runtime, manual TP01-TP10 checklist, and resolved infra fixes (`/auth` reverse proxy and API runtime dependencies).

## Decision Log
- Kept scope limited to infrastructure and workspace scaffolding only (no NestJS or React implementation).
- Used Bun initialization for root and workspace packages, then consolidated dependency install at root.
- Standardized workspace script execution via `bun run --filter` (the installed Bun version does not support `-w`).
- Marked Plan 001 overview as completed after scaffolding and config alignment.
- Added `TokenRequestSchema` and `TokenResponseSchema` in shared package as the single source of truth for contract validation/types.
- Configured `@livemeet/shared-types` `exports`/`types` to resolve cleanly via Bun workspaces.
- Added build output (`dist`) and package scripts (`build`, `typecheck`, `test`) for pre-NestJS validation gates.
- Selected TypeORM + PostgreSQL for API persistence to align with PRD and reduce setup time in NestJS.
- Adopted `nestjs-zod` with global `ZodValidationPipe` and DTOs generated from `@livemeet/shared-types` schemas to prevent contract drift.
- Kept E2E tests focused on auth route contract/JWT payload while mocking persistence boundary for deterministic CI execution.
- README mantido aderente ao estado real do repositorio (sem prometer funcionalidades ainda nao implementadas).
- Adopted a multi-stage API Dockerfile that builds `@livemeet/shared-types` before `@livemeet/api` to preserve workspace contract isolation at container runtime.
- Kept Docker install step as `bun install` (instead of frozen lockfile) due Bun version/lockfile drift inside containerized workspace resolution.
- Added Vite API proxy in dev to solve CORS without changing backend controller behavior.
- Marked Plan 004 as `[IN_PROGRESS]` and explicitly set the scaffolding task as `[DONE]` while keeping feature implementation tasks pending.
- Chose runtime schema parsing in frontend token flow (request + response) to keep strict contract parity with backend and shared-types.
- Completed Plan 004 and marked all planned frontend tasks as `[DONE]`.
- Chose `nginx:alpine` as web runtime image for lightweight static delivery and predictable SPA behavior in Docker.
- Kept Docker Compose `version` field unchanged despite warning, per user instruction to ignore that warning in this phase.
- Explicitly marked LiveKit `7882` mapping as UDP in Compose to match `livekit.yaml rtc.udp_port` and local manual test expectations.
- Chose Nginx reverse-proxy strategy (Option A) for `/auth` instead of backend-wide CORS changes, keeping same-origin frontend requests in production container mode.
- Chose to keep Bun runtime execution (`bun apps/api/dist/main.js`) and fix dependency availability by copying workspace-level `node_modules` into the API runtime image.
- Consolidated project documentation in `README.md` to remove stale statements and reflect the current runnable flow for both Docker and local development.

## Blockers
- Resolved: Web container returned `405 Not Allowed` for `POST /auth/token` because static Nginx had no `/auth` proxy.
- Solution: Added `location /auth { proxy_pass http://api:3000; ... }` to `apps/web/nginx.conf`.
- Resolved: API container failed with `Cannot find package 'reflect-metadata'` due missing workspace runtime dependencies in final API image.
- Solution: Updated `apps/api/Dockerfile` to copy `apps/api/node_modules` and `packages/shared-types/node_modules` into runtime stage.
